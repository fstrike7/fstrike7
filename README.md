## 🚀 Featured Projects

### **[provincial-indicators-pipeline](https://github.com/fstrike7/provincial-indicators-pipeline)**

Personal **DevOps & Data Engineering** project where I designed and implemented an **end-to-end ETL pipeline**, focusing on automation, scalability, and observability.

**Key aspects:**
- **AWS (ECS, S3, VPC, IAM, Secrets)** for cloud infrastructure.
- **Docker + GitHub Actions (CI/CD)** for automated builds and deployments.
- **Python** for data extraction, transformation, and normalization.
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform).
